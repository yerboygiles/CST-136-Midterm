All the natural resources, animals, etc will first be instantiated, including
Adam and Eve, who are humans, and Fido, a very aggressive dog. 

Adam first harvests a bush, a tree, and a rock so he can craft a Multitool.
If this somehow makes him tired, there is a cout, and he will eventually need
to eat, and sleep in the house he makes later on.

Now that he has a multitool, he harvests a bush and eats its berries in 
case hes hungry yet. This will remove hungry statuses.

He then harvests a flower, and also goes around to gather more resources
with his multitool to gain the resources required for a knife.

He compares the knife and multitool as some sort of very primitive caveman
research, and finds that the multitool is bigger.

Then, he hunts a chicken, hitting it many times with his knife until he can
harvest it for meat and feathers.

Fido approaches adam and barks, scaring him. The dog also bites adam, 
lowering his health.

Being scared by the dog makes him want to make a house, so he gathers the
required resources, and crafts a house, and moves into it.

He adds Eve to the list of people who live in his house, as well as his baby 
that he makes with eve, and lets you name.

Eve goes out and nurtures/waters the bushes around, and adam rests in his house after a long day.
